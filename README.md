### Difference between normal ores

This "ore", doesn't spawn underground!\
Instead, it spawns in the sky; that's why it's called "cloud".

An ore will be spawned somewhere in the schematic!\
You'll have certain probabilities to have an ore or not!

- For small clouds: 2.5% of getting an ore per node.
- For medium clouds: 5% of getting an ore per node.
- For big clouds: 7.5% of getting an ore per node.
